# STM32 Blackpill Baremetal Application
This is a bare metal application for the STM32F411CE "Blackpill" dev board.

The intention for this software is to create a simple serial device that can
then be reverse engineered to run on a unicorn emulator.

## Zig
I have been trying to build the baremetal C application with zig's build system `build.zig`
